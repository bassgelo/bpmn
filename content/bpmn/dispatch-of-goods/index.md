## Background

This process happens at a small hardware company that ships small amounts of goods to end customers but also larger orders to other businesses.

### Task: Model the following process.

If goods need shipping, the secretary first clarifies who is responsible for doing the shipping.
If the order contains large amounts, special delivery will be necessary. In that case, the secretary invites three logistics companies to make offers, and she or he selects one of them. 

In case of small amounts, normal delivery by post is suitable. Therefore, the secretary prints a label for the parcel. If necessary, the head of logistics takes care of taking out insurance for the parcel. In the meantime, the warehousemen are responsible for packaging the goods. This step is required regardless of the method of shipping.

As soon as everything is ready, the warehousemen prepare the packaged goods for pick up by the logistics company or the post.

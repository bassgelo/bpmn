## Background

Insurance policyholders can be forced to pay back the money they received from the insurance company for various reasons. This procedure is called recourse. In the following text, the clerk describes how this process works.

### Task: Model the following process.

If a policyholder could be legally pursued to recover a claim, I get information about that case.

I first check the case for potential subrogation. Then, I send a request for payment to the policyholder and set a reminder for myself to follow up with the client. If recourse is not possible, I close the case. 

If we receive the money, I process the payment and close the case. If the policyholder objects, I’ll have to check the reason for his or her disagreement. In case the policyholder was right, I would close the case without further action. Otherwise, I would forward the case to a collection agency.

If the follow-up were due and we haven’t received any money, I would also forward the case to the collection agency.
